<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Ethical Policy to Prevent Addictive Use of KenHealthPost</h3>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;As developers of a mental health support app, we recognize the ethical responsibility to prevent excessive use or dependency on KenHealthPost. While our application is built to foster healthy behaviors and emotional support, overuse of technology, even for good intentions, can lead to negative consequences such as anxiety, dependency, or distraction from real-life relationships. This policy outlines how we will mitigate such risks from a Christian ethical perspective and with insights drawn from Nir Eyal and other experts on technology addiction.
</p>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Identifying Potential Risks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;Addictive behavior in KenHealthPost may manifest in the form of:

üîÑ Over-checking for messages or feedback.

üí¨ Compulsive participation in community discussions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Excessive journaling or self-monitoring that increases anxiety.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">&emsp;&emsp;Although these activities are meant to promote positive habits, excessive use can contribute to stress or avoidant behaviors. As Irina Slavina (2020) points out in the context of gambling and digital platforms, developers must be aware of how product design influences user behavior and take steps to prevent harm.

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Healthy Usage Guidelines</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;Based on mental health research and a Christian worldview that promotes moderation and intentionality (1 Corinthians 6:12), we recommend:

‚úÖ 15‚Äì30 minutes per day of active engagement.

‚úÖ A maximum of 1 hour daily usage, including journaling, browsing, or interacting with therapists or peers.

‚úÖ Promoting offline wellness activities such as in-person therapy, prayer, exercise, or family interactions.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;The application will gently prompt users who exceed this limit with reminders such as: ‚ÄúConsider taking a break to rest your mind and reconnect offline.‚Äù

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Design for Accountability and Awareness</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;We will integrate design features inspired by Stack Overflow‚Äôs reputation safeguards and Eyal‚Äôs article Is Some Tech Too Addictive?

‚û§  Usage reports that show daily and weekly activity.

‚û§  Session time alerts after 30 minutes of continuous usage.

‚û§  Positive nudges suggesting healthy behavior such as ‚Äúpause and reflect‚Äù or ‚Äústep outside for fresh air.‚Äù
These tools help users become more mindful of their time, while still engaging meaningfully with the platform.

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Spiritual and Ethical Alignment</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;From a Christian perspective, it is important to view our users as whole persons, not just data points or engagement metrics. We value human dignity and freedom, which means our design must promote flourishing, not dependence. Echoing Eyal‚Äôs (2019) assertion, ‚ÄúAddiction is not about the product, it‚Äôs about the user‚Äôs context,‚Äù we strive to create an environment that supports mental health without exploiting vulnerabilities.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;We also encourage therapists using the platform to monitor patterns of compulsive behavior and intervene with supportive, human-led strategies when necessary.

## Conclusion

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;KenHealthPost exists to serve and uplift users, not to trap them in compulsive behaviors. By establishing ethical guidelines, tracking time usage, and providing spiritual and psychological safeguards, we can deliver a product that respects user boundaries and promotes true well-being. Technology should be a tool for healing and growth. It should not be another source of addiction.
