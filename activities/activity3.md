<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Key Relationships, Customers, and Revenue Streams</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;KenHealthPost is strategically built around a strong partnership with TerrosHealth, the primary client and sole financial backer of the application. This relationship eliminates the need for external investors and allows the platform to remain fully aligned with the clinical and operational goals of the organization. The core customers include mental health patients seeking peer support and wellness resources, as well as mental health professionals who contribute expertise and guidance within the community. Although the platform is free to end-users, the revenue stream is sustained entirely through TerrosHealth’s funding, which covers development, infrastructure, compliance, and ongoing support. This unique model ensures that the application remains mission-driven, accessible, and adaptable to the evolving needs of its users and stakeholders.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;KenHealthPost primarily serves mental health patients seeking a confidential online space to connect and share support (Naslund, Aschbrenner, Marsch, & Bartels, 2016). Mental health professionals such as therapists and counselors provide guidance, fostering a trusted environment (Naslund et al., 2016). TerrosHealth, the primary financer, focuses on enhancing patient outcomes and community wellness (Kenning, 2020). Caregivers and families may also use the platform as a resource hub (Mohr et al., 2017).</p>

&emsp;&emsp;The platform offers a safe, moderated social network focused on mental wellness, providing anonymity options and evidence-based resources to reduce stigma (Naslund et al., 2016). Features like support groups and professional Q&A enhance engagement, directly supporting TerrosHealth’s mission of improving mental health care delivery (Kenning, 2020).</p>

&emsp;&emsp;The app is fully funded by TerrosHealth, eliminating user fees and enabling free access (Kenning, 2020). Potential future revenue could stem from grants, sponsorships aligned with mental health initiatives, or partnerships, all reinforcing the platform’s mission without compromising accessibility (Mohr et al., 2017).</p>

TerrosHealth provides essential funding and strategic guidance (Kenning, 2020).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;Ongoing activities involve software development, rigorous testing, and deployment, alongside active community moderation to maintain safety (Naslund et al., 2016). Content creation and curation are regularly updated to reflect current research and user needs. Continuous monitoring for data privacy and regulatory compliance is maintained (Mohr et al., 2017).</p>

&emsp;&emsp;TerrosHealth acts as the primary financier and strategic partner (Kenning, 2020). Partnerships with mental health organizations and professionals enrich content and credibility (Naslund et al., 2016). Technology providers offer cloud hosting and cybersecurity, while advocacy groups aid outreach efforts (Mohr et al., 2017).</p>

<h4><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">9.  Cost Structure</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
