<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Evaluation of the Two Posts</h3> 
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;"> &emsp;&emsp;The original post effectively lists the core details of the job, ensuring that all critical information, such as salary, qualifications, and purpose is clearly presented. However, it presents all items in a single bullet-point block within a paragraph, which makes scanning for key information less efficient. Additionally, the original lacks strong section headings that could guide the reader’s eye, and it doesn’t explicitly emphasize the strategic value of the role in a way that sells the position to internal decision-makers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;"> &emsp;&emsp;The improved post applies best practices by breaking the information into clearly labeled sections, using concise yet descriptive headings, and separating content into digestible blocks. This enhances readability and ensures important details like start date, employment type, and qualifications stand out. Furthermore, the improved version reframes the “Purpose” and “Requisition Reason” into compelling role descriptions and justifications that communicate the role’s impact, aligning the requisition more closely with organizational goals and strategic hiring priorities.</p>

## Conclusion
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;Overall, while the original post conveys the essential details, the improved version delivers them with greater clarity, organization, and persuasive framing. By highlighting the role’s strategic importance and presenting information in a structured, reader-friendly format, the revised post is far more effective in attracting attention and gaining approval from decision-makers.
