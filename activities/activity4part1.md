<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">Title: Enhancing User Loyalty with Hooked Features in KenHealthPost</h3>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;KenHealthPost is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to support mental health patients and professionals by offering secure communication, appointment updates, peer interactions, and educational content. To build long-term user engagement, the application will incorporate the four principles of Nir Eyal’s Hook Model: Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment (Eyal, 2014). These principles will guide key feature enhancements aimed at boosting user retention and loyalty. Additionally, persuasive design strategies (Fogg, 2003) and habit-building techniques (Clear, 2018) offer complementary insights that support the Hook Model approach.
</p>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">Triggers</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;A trigger initiates user interaction with the app. In KenHealthPost, push notifications and email reminders serve as external triggers to prompt users about new messages from their therapist, appointment revisions, or new community content. Over time, internal triggers such as emotional cues (feeling anxious or lonely) should drive users to open the app when they seek support or reassurance.
</p>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">Action</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;An action is a behavior done in anticipation of a reward. In KenHealthPost, this includes reading motivational posts, checking feedback from a therapist, or participating in peer discussions. To make these actions easier, the app will include:

📝 A “Daily Check-In” one-tap journaling feature.

🏠 A redesigned homepage dashboard that shows recent messages, upcoming appointments, and community updates in one scrollable view.

These design changes simplify the process, making it effortless for users to take action every time they open the app (Eyal, 2014; Fogg, 2003).
</p>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">Variable Rewards</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;KenHealthPost will integrate variable rewards in three categories:

🤝 Tribe:  Positive reinforcement through community likes, support messages, and therapist feedback.

🔍 Hunt:  A curated feed of new mental health articles or motivational quotes personalized by mood.

🎖️ Self:  Progress badges for journaling consistency or participating in group discussions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;These variable rewards satisfy the need for connection, discovery, and achievement, which are key drivers for repeat engagement.
</p>

<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">Investment</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;User investment increases commitment to the app. KenHealthPost encourages investment in several ways:

🗂️ Saving personal journaling entries.

📈 Tracking therapy progress via revision notes. 

👍 Building peer reputation through helpful comments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;Each action makes the app more valuable and personalized, which increases the likelihood that users will return. Additionally, stored data (such as therapy history or personalized support preferences) makes the app more relevant over time, reinforcing user loyalty (Fogg, 2003).
</p>

## Conclusion

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em;">
&emsp;&emsp;By applying the Hook Model to KenHealthPost, we aim to create a habit-forming experience that encourages frequent, meaningful use of the platform. These design enhancements not only improve usability and engagement but also align with the platform’s mission to support mental wellness in a human-centered and ethical way (Eyal, 2014; Clear, 2018).
