<h3><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;This report includes all the essential MVP(Minimum Viable Product) features that KenHealthPost must have to fullfil the mental health patient needs. Also, Nice to Have and Future Plans are covered in this design. The MVP features were identified considering that this new networking platform is intended to support people facing mental health issues.  
</p>


<h4><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">1. MVP Definition</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp;The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product development approach focused on launching a new solution with just enough core functionality to satisfy early users and gather meaningful feedback. The aim is to reduce development time and effort while gaining insights into user needs and market interest. By starting with a simplified version of the product, teams can test ideas, confirm demand, and make informed decisions for future improvements. This concept was widely introduced by Eric Ries in his Lean Startup methodology, which encourages building, measuring, and learning as a cycle for innovation (Ries, 2011).</p>

<h4><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">2. Essential MVP for Social Networking Platforms</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 4.5em; margin-left: 3.5em; margin-right: 3.5em;">
&emsp;&emsp; After a careful research and revision of the available bibliography, I found that some popular Social Platform MVPs are structured around essential features like user authentication, posting systems, and basic interactions (Ries, 2011; Blank & Dorf, 2012; Maurya, 2012). These MVPs focus on validating the core idea while offering just enough functionality to gather user feedback and iterate quickly, which aligns with modern lean and agile development principles. 

&emsp;&emsp;-User accounts (register/login/profile)

&emsp;&emsp;-Create/read posts or messages

&emsp;&emsp;-Like/comment functionality

&emsp;&emsp;-Basic feed or timeline

&emsp;&emsp;-Search bar

&emsp;&emsp;-Resources(Educational  and Support Content)

&emsp;&emsp;-Follow/friend feature (optional)

&emsp;&emsp;-Notifications (optional or simple email)</p>

 &emsp;&emsp;Currently, most of the recommended features have been considered and included in the Design of the platform. However, to improve the User Experience at KenHealth, some additional optional features will be considered. One of them if the Notification feature and other will be follow a friend.

## Conclusion
<p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify;">&emsp;&emsp;The initial analysis of this project carefully identified and categorized user stories into three key groups: <strong>Essential Features</strong>, <strong>Nice to Have</strong>, and <strong>Future Versions</strong>. This approach ensures that the core functionality is addressed early on while still leaving room for meaningful enhancements and innovation over time. Features such as account creation, post management, and user interaction were prioritized to provide a functional and engaging base experience.</p> <p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: justify;">&emsp;&emsp;However, as the project evolves under the Scrum framework, new user needs and technical improvements will be continuously evaluated and integrated. This agile process supports ongoing feedback, allowing the product to grow beyond the initial MVP and adapt to emerging expectations. By remaining iterative and user-centered, the platform is positioned for long-term impact and flexibility.</p>
